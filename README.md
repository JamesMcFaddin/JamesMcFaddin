# 👋 Hi, I'm James E. McFaddin

I'm a software developer with decades of real-world experience—from writing embedded assembly in the 1970s to building Python-based cloud-integrated systems today.

I started using GitHub to stop losing code to dead disks and forgotten folders. This is my way of preserving work, sharing active projects, and maybe helping someone avoid a rabbit hole I’ve already crawled through.

I still write code. I still fix things. I still break stuff just to see how it ticks.

## 🎣 When Not Coding...

You'll probably find me fishing, behind a camera, or yelling at a Raspberry Pi that worked yesterday.  

I’ve been around long enough to know that sometimes, turning it off and back on really *does* fix it.
