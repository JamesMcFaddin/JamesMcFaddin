# James McFaddin

**Veteran Software Engineer | Raspberry Pi & Python Automation | Embedded to Enterprise | Patented Inventor | Still Shipping**

👋 Welcome. I’m James McFaddin — a veteran developer who’s been shipping software since punch cards were still warm. My work spans real-time control systems, embedded hardware, Windows GUIs, and cloud-connected digital signage built on Raspberry Pi.

I use GitHub as a cloud archive for my projects — to preserve work, prevent “lost history,” and occasionally launch something new.

## 🔧 Current Focus Areas
- **Raspberry Pi automation** for digital signage and smart displays
- **Python development** with real-world deployment in retail and bar environments
- **Google & Microsoft Cloud APIs**: Contacts, Calendar, Drive, Facebook Graph API
- **VLC, video scheduling**, and content synchronization for real-time ad playback
- **System automation** with `systemd`, Bash, and Python

## 🛠️ Technologies Worked With
- **Languages**: Python, C, C++, C#, Visual Basic, JavaScript, Assembly (x86, 80x86, Z80)
- **Frameworks**: MFC, ATL, COM/DCOM, ASP.NET, SQL Server
- **Platforms**: Raspberry Pi (Linux), Windows (NT to 11), VMS, OS/2
- **Interfaces**: USB, SPI, TDM, Serial
- **Cloud Services**: Google Cloud APIs, Facebook Graph API, Microsoft Azure (light use)
- **Microprocessors**: Intel's 8048, 8051, 8080, (Z80), 8088, 80186 & 80188  
  Analog Device’s Blackfin & SHARC DSPs • AMD’s MicroBlaze • RTOS embedded systems

## 🧠 Noteworthy
In 1999, while working at Broadcast.com during its Yahoo acquisition, I developed a prototype called **AdMerge** — a system that replaced manual video ad insertion with fully automated merging, tracking, and billing. It eliminated an entire infrastructure from client delivery to VCR tape playback to logging. The dot-com crash derailed the patent, but the core ideas live on in today’s streaming ad tech.
