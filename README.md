## 👋 About Me

With over 40 years in software development — from 8-bit assembly to full-stack cloud integrations — I’ve written code that runs everything from gas chromatographs to LED bar signage, and plenty in between.

This GitHub represents more than just projects. It’s a response to a problem I’ve faced: *Lost history.* Code written and lost to obsolete disks and machines. This is where it lives on.

## ⚙️ Current Focus Areas

- 🎛 Raspberry Pi automation (Python, systemd, VLC)
- ☁️ Cloud integrations: Google API (Contacts, Calendar), Facebook Graph API
- 🧠 AdProcess — a Python-based media player system with cloud playlist sync
- 🔌 Networked signage and dynamic ad display systems
- 💡 Reviving old ideas with modern tools

## 🧠 Notable Innovations

### 🧪 US Patent #4524420A — [Signal Processing Apparatus](https://patents.google.com/patent/US4524420A/en)
Filed in the 1980s during the heyday of gas chromatography. This system enhanced the signal output from chromatographs, optimizing readings for medical and industrial applications.

### 📝 US Patent Application #20030056213A1 — [AdMerge](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20030056213A1/en)
Created in 1999 while at Broadcast.com (right before the Yahoo acquisition). This early prototype replaced an entire VHS-based ad infrastructure with digital ad insertion, playback logging, and automated billing — essentially inventing what we now call adtech. It was written in a week and worked reliably before the .com crash halted it.

### 📝 US Patent Application #20030056213A1 — [AdMerge](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20030056213A1/en)

In 1999, I joined Broadcast.com just weeks before it was acquired by Yahoo. At the time, ad insertion was literally done by humans clicking between live streams and VHS tapes.

Within a week, I had cobbled together a prototype system I called **AdMerge** — an automated pipeline that replaced an entire infrastructure: from clients recording ads onto physical tapes and shipping them with schedules, to us loading them manually into VCRs. My system accepted emailed ads, handled timed playback, and automatically logged events for billing.

Yahoo offered me $1 to sign over the IP. I passed.
